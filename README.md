Title:         Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - MSU MD Version
System:        SEGA GENESIS / MEGA DRIVE (JP, US) [60Hz]
               

Compatibility  Works on real hardware with 
               MEGA Everdrive Pro (preferred flashcart), 
               MegaSD* or 
               Cart/CD combo*
               mister*
               RetroArch GenesisPlusGX core (preferred emulator)
               Kega Fusion is not working due to an issue with broken DMA when CD support is active in emulation
               (*untested on my end)

### HOW TO USE

1. Obtain source ROM.
2. Use the BPS patch file from the current release to patch your ROM. I recommend FLIPS. 
   -> https://dl.smwcentral.net/11474/floating.zip
3. Download the SoundPacks and make sure the rom and cue files have identical base-filenames (eg. game.md and game.cue)
4. Make sure all files are in the same folder
5. If using an emulator, make sure you are using the correct CD bios files!
